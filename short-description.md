JSON-to-Cypher Mapper (JSON2Cypher)

JSON-to-Cypher Mapper (JSON2Cypher) is a TypeScript utility that transforms JSON data into executable Cypher queries for Neo4j. By defining a declarative mapping schema, developers can specify how nodes and relationships should be created, identified, and connected, enabling seamless conversion of nested or hierarchical JSON structures into graph representations. Whether you have simple user–company datasets or complex order–line item hierarchies, JSON2Cypher handles the heavy lifting of generating CREATE and MERGE statements based on your configuration.

Key features include flexible ID strategies (UUID generation, sourcing from data fields, or fixed reference nodes), powerful property mapping via JSONPath with type conversions and default values, and a sub-mapping mechanism to handle nested collections. The mapper leverages context variables (e.g., `$current`, `$parent`, `$global`) to create relationships across different levels of your data, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistent graph modeling. Extensibility through custom transformers and integration with the Neo4j driver round out a toolkit designed to adapt to a variety of data integration scenarios.

With a zero-dependency core and a browser-based playground for rapid experimentation, JSON2Cypher is an ideal solution for teams looking to bridge JSON-based applications and graph databases. From proof-of-concept demos to production-scale data migrations, it simplifies the process of turning your existing JSON payloads into robust, schema-driven graph data.
