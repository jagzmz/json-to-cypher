JSON2Cypher (JSON-to-Cypher Mapper) is a TypeScript library designed to seamlessly translate JSON data into executable Cypher queries for Neo4j. With a declarative schema based on intuitive mapping objects, you can define how nodes, properties, and relationships should be generated or merged in your graph. The library supports flexible identification strategies—including UUID generation, data-driven IDs, and fixed reference values—enabling robust handling of both dynamic and shared entities like categories or tags.

Using JSON2Cypher, you can leverage JSONPath expressions to extract and transform data fields, apply custom transformers, and navigate nested data structures through sub-mappings. Reference nodes automatically use MERGE to prevent duplicates, and nested contexts allow you to build parent-child relationships with ease. Whether you are handling simple flat objects or complex hierarchical payloads, JSON2Cypher provides the tools to define reusable mapping rules and generate consistent Cypher statements.

Getting started is straightforward: install the package, define your mapping schema, and invoke the `generateQueries` method with your JSON payload. The output is an array of query strings paired with parameter objects ready for execution via any Neo4j driver.
