JSON-to-Cypher Mapper (JSON2Cypher) is a lightweight TypeScript library designed to convert arbitrary JSON data into executable Cypher queries for Neo4j. By defining a simple, declarative schema, you can automate the creation of nodes and relationships, map JSON fields to properties, and handle complex nested structures with ease.

At its core, JSON2Cypher uses configurable mapping rules to generate `CREATE` and `MERGE` statements along with parameter objects. You can choose unique ID strategies (UUID, data-driven, or fixed), apply JSONPath expressions to extract and transform values, and merge reference nodes to prevent duplicates. The library also supports custom transformers and default values, giving you fine-grained control over how your data is modeled in the graph.

Integration with Neo4j is straightforward: simply import the generated queries into your driver of choice (e.g., `neo4j-driver`) and execute them against your database. JSON2Cypher removes boilerplate from data import pipelines, accelerates prototyping, and ensures consistency when loading JSON-based datasets into graph structures.
